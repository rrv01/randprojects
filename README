Rohit's GPS-GPRMC Parser

From the NMEA protocol description, the details for the GPRMC statement are:

GPRMC - NMEA has its own version of essential gps pvt (position, velocity, time) data.
It is called RMC, The Recommended Minimum, which will look similar to:
$GPRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A
Where:
     RMC          Recommended Minimum sentence C
     123519       Fix taken at 12:35:19 UTC
     A            Status A=active or V=Void.
     4807.038,N   Latitude 48 deg 07.038' N
     01131.000,E  Longitude 11 deg 31.000' E
     022.4        Speed over the ground in knots
     084.4        Track angle in degrees True
     230394       Date - 23rd of March 1994
     003.1,W      Magnetic Variation
     *6A          The checksum data, always begins with *


Usage:
The parser accepts a stream of input characters at STDIN.
cat input_gps_data.txt | ./parser

For simplicity, here are a couple of minor assumptions and usage behavior:
1. Required input is a continuous stream of characters.
	a) Any '\n' or '\r' will terminate the parser at the input.
2. Currently, input is accepted on STDIN *only*.
3. Output is stored in current directory in a file named "gps_output_data.txt"
4. Easiest way to run the parser is to pipe the input stream to parser as shown above.
6. A sample input file with random GPS data has been included.

Inner Specifics:
1. The parser continuously accepts character to form a complete sentence.
2. It then creates a new thread that parses the single statement and writes it to file if the data is valid.
3. Writes to the file are synchronized. This ensures that there are multiple threads parsing different lines
in parallel to the main thread that just does io-read. The thread exits after writing to the file.
4. The parser will quit after it has parsed and written MAX_GPS_OUTPUT_LINES lines. This is set to 100.
5. Use #define DEBUG to print debug messages while the parser is running.
